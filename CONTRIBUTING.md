F-Droid provides good [guidance](https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/) on *Anti-Features*.

Entries are sorted alphabetically.

## F-Droid links

If a package is available on [**F-Droid**](https://f-droid.org/) it can be linked using the `https://f-droid.org/app/<App ID>` URL.
If not yet, it's a good idea to promote F-Droid submission to the projects developer.

[**IzzyOnDroid**](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/) can be linked using `https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/<App ID>` only, if the package is *not* available on F-Droid and *not* marked by *NonFreeComp*.

Please do not submit other third party F-Droid repositories or Google Play.
